# main.c
## Purpose
This program creates a graph of integers ranging from $[1, n]$, where n is given by the user. Each node is then linked to all other integers that are relatively coprime.
This is my first step towards helping solve the problem specified in [Josh Ganschow's PrimeGridLabeling repo](https://github.com/GanschowJosh/PrimeGridLabeling).
